            company founded in 2024 to tackle a critical social impact project:
            reducing food waste in Canada. Did you know that $49 billion worth
            of food is wasted or lost in Canada each year? That's enough to feed
            every Canadian for five months! Moreover, the annual cost of food
            waste for each household is $1,766.
