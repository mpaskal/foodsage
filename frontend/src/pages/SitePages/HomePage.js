            <h2>Food Waste</h2>
            <p>
              Food waste is a major issue that affects the environment, economy,
              and society. According to the United Nations, about one-third of
              all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted
              globally. This amounts to approximately 1.3 billion tons of food
              wasted each year, which has significant social, economic, and
              environmental impacts. Food waste contributes to hunger and
              malnutrition, increases greenhouse gas emissions, and wastes
              valuable resources such as water, energy, and labor. By reducing
              food waste, we can help address these issues and create a more
              sustainable food system for future generations.
