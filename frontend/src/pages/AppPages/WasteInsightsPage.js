            <h2 className="h2-name2">Understanding Food Waste</h2>
            <p>
              Food waste can be categorized into several types, including
              spoilage, overproduction, expiration, and plate waste.
              Understanding the common causes of food waste, such as improper
              storage, buying too much, and poor meal planning, is the first
              step towards reducing it.Moreover, engaging in food waste
              reduction practices can inspire innovations in food storage,
              distribution, and consumption, paving the way for a more efficient
              and equitable food system. By collectively addressing the issue of
              food waste, we can help ensure that the resources used in food
              production are utilized to their fullest potential, ultimately
              contributing to a healthier planet and society.
